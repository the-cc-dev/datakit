### 0.11.0 (2017-07-07)

The main change in this release is the addition of `datakit-client-git`
which implements the DataKit API on top of a normal Git repository. This
means that the deployment of DataKit tools is now much simpler as they do
not need a running DataKit server anymore. The client and server packages
have been renamed to make the use of 9p more explicit. Support for more
transport is planned, including gRPC and Cap-n-proto.

**Go bindings**

- Go: Separate user config from defaults in the database (#523, @djs55)
- Go: add `List` to list files in snapshots (#578, @ebriney)

**datakit-server, datakit-client**

- client/server: split the libraires between core API and 9p transport.

  There is now:
  - `datakit-client`: signature for client API + Path library
  - `datakit-server`: implementation of the VFS on top of Irmin
  - `datakit-client-9p`: implementation of the API using 9p as transport
  - `datakit-server-9p`: expose the Irmin VFS as the Datakit API; server-side
     implementation of the API using 9p as transport

  The tests are split as well, so all the client/server tests can be re-used
  with a different transport mechanism. (#551, @samoht)

- client: add a top-level `Datakit_client` module namespace: `Datakit_S.CLIENT`
  becomes `Datakit_client.S` and `Datakit_path` becomes `Datakit_client.Path`
  (#558, @samoht)

- client: remove `rename` API calls (#563, @samoht)

**datakit-client-9p**

`datakit-client-9p` is now the new name for the previously named
`datakit-client`. That package contains the 9p client bindings to the DataKit
API. More clients to come.

- 9p client: `DK.commit` now fails if the commit does not exists (instead of
  failing later when the commit is used) (#565, @samoht)

**datakit-client-git**

- git client: add client bindings using Git directly, without the need for a
  DataKit server (#559, @samoht)

**datakit**

- datakit: move all modules under the `Datakit` namespace. Expose
  `Datakit.Blob`, `Datakit.Branch`, `Datakit.Hash,` `Datakit.Metadata`,
  `Datakit.Path` forming the base types for DataKit stores. Also expose
  `Datakit.Make` (and `Datakit.Make_git`) to build a DataKit store from an
  `Irmin` store (or from a `Irmin_git` store). Finally, rename the functor
  to expose a DataKit store into a virtual file-system into `Datakit.VFS`
  (#583, @samoht)
- datakit: use irmin 1.2.0 and git 1.11.0 (#556, @samoht)
- datakit: use mtime 1.0 (#560, @samoht)
- datakit: stop using camlzip, switch to decompress (#570, @samoht)

**datakit-github**

- github: expose PR's owner (#587, @samoht)

**datakit-github-bridge**

- github bridge: look at the GH token in various places (#577, @samoht)
- github bridge: add the ability to monitor default repositories using the CLI
  (#577, @samoht)
- github bridge: allow to use `git://<path>` urls to "connect" to a local Git
  repo instead of a 9p DataKit server (#577, @samoht). For instance:

      $ datakit-bridge-github -r samoht/test -d git:///tmp/foo --resync 60

  will download all the issues and PR into a Git repository `/tmp/foo` and will
  keep it up-to-date when changes occur either on GitHub (with a full resync
  every 60s) or locally by commiting updates in the `/tmp/foo` Git repository.

**datakit-ci**

- use redis 0.3.5 (#562, #567, @samoht)

### 0.10.1 (2017-05-09)

**all**

- Update to support protocol-9p and protocol-9p-unix 0.11.0
  (#547, #549 by @avsm, @samoht)
- Update to support lwt 3.0.0 (#547, #549 by @avsm, @samoht)

### 0.10.0 (2017-04-28)

DataKit has a new home: the [Moby Project](http://mobyproject.org/)!

**all**

- Rename docker/datakit into moby/datakit (#528, @talex5)
- The Docker images on Hub have moved to [datakit](https://hub.docker.com/u/datakit/):
  Use `docker run datakit/db` to run the database (see README.md)
- Use jbuilder to build the project. Total project build time pass from ~1min
  to less than 10s and identifed a few issues with linking local/global names.
  For instance `Datakit_conduit` were depending on datakit-server and it was
  not clear which version it was linked with (#532, @samoht)

**datakit-local-git** (new)

- bridge-local-git: add local git bridge (#458, @talex5)

Normally, we use datakit-github to monitor the state of a remote

started with DataKitCI it is more convenient to be able to monitor a
local Git repository.

**datakit-bridge-github** (new)

- bridge-github: split the `datakit-github` package into 2: `datakit-github`

- ci: allow configuring CI name, dashboard config in config file (@306, @talex5)
- ci: Add library for writing DataKit-based Continuous Integration systems
  (#302, @talex5)

**datakit-github**

- github: add a more specific error when there is no datakit-github token
  (#323, @avsm)
- github: major refactoring to use only one branch in datakit to persist
  the data and keep the rest in memory otherwise. Also use a stronger model
  of ownership to decide whether datakit or GitHub is right (#311, @samoht)

**datakit**

- datakit: update to irmin.0.12.0 to use faster native watch notifications
  instead of file-system polling and full scanning (#347, @samoht)

**datakit-client**

- client: simplify path handling: when creating things, pass the full
  path as one argument rather than a directory and a name. (#306, @talex5)

**datakit-server**

- server: Fix log-destination command-line arguments (#340, @samoht)
- server: improve named-pipe support (#333, by @simonferquel and @samoht)
- server: Catch top level Lwt.async exceptions (#327, @samoht)
- server: expose `Vfs.Logs` to expose the state of `Logs.Src` over 9p. This

(#232, @samoht)

**datakit-github**

- github: add Dockerfiles (@talex5 and @samoht)
- github: Lots of stability improvement and bug fixes for the GitHub bridge,
  including:
  - Integrate the GH webhooks directly with the bridge process (#243, @samoht)
  - Track Git References in the GitHub bridge (#234, @samoht)
  - Be more rebust when GitHub API calls fail (#241, @samoht)
  - Fuzz testing of GitHub state and user requests (TODO)

- server: Make `--bare` the default behavior (#185, @samoht)
- server: Allow to auto-push datakit state to GitHub (#189, @samoht)
- client, server: Use maximum_write_payload funtion in recent ocaml-9p
  (#192, @talex5)

- server: Add `/debug` directory to control log levels (#239, @talex5)

**datakit-client**

- client: add Dockerfiles (@talex5 and @samoht)
- client: Improve mount options of datakit-mount (#105, @samoht)
- client, server, github: add Dockerfiles (@talex5 and @samoht)
- client, server: Add a way to trigger remote fetches within the API
  (#132, @samoht)

- client: Expose diffs in the Datakit API (#219, @samoht)

### 0.4.0 (2016-04-25)

- Bindings to the Github events API to get notification on new pull requests
  (#63, @samoht)

    ```
while read PR do
  echo New PR: $PR
  echo pending > /db/github.com/docker/datakit/pr/status/test
  ...
done < /db/github.com/docker/datakit/pr/updates
    ```
- Allow to set the description and urls for pull request status (#64, @samoht)
- Update VFS to report file metadata (#66, @talex5)
- Add `stats` to file metadata (#66, @talex5)
- Replace "Buffer to small" error with a read of 0 items (#71, @talex5)
  Linux reads a directory like like:
    - Linux asks us to fill an 8K buffer.
    - We return nearly 8K (must return a whole number of items).
    - Linux asks us to fill the remaining few bytes.
    - We return nothing.
    - Linux flushes its buffer and asks for the next 8K.
    ...
  This means we get roughly twice as many roundtrips as needed, but it
  does work.
- Allow renaming files in a transaction (#73, @talex5)
- Metadata support (executable files and symlinks):
    - creation of executable files
    - creation of symlinks
    - chmod +x works
    - writing preserves the executable flag
    - merging now also merges metadata
  This appears to be sufficient to build Docker under Datakit  (#69, @talex5)
- Don't allow fast-forward to missing commit (#81, @talex5)
- Simplify the `Vfs.File.Stream` API and use it consistently through the
  codebase (#83, @samoht)
    - stream files have a state
    - when you open a stream file, you immediately get a line with the current
      state
    - as long as you keep the file open, you get a newline for every updates
    - you can have multiple reader (e.g. concurrently open files)
    - the writers as "publish" functions in the VFS API, you can have multiple
      concurrent writers. In that case, the behaviour is similar to condition
      broadcasts: every reader should receive the updates in the same order.

### 0.3.0 (2016-04-04)

- Fix a memory leak. This was due to a missing `free` in the readdir
  bindings in the upstream Lwt library, see
  https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/229 (#57 by @talex5 and @samoht)
- Fix a regression introduced in 0.2.0 where inode numbers were not stable
  anymore, which broke `cp` commands (#56 by @talex5)
- Enable verbose mode by setting the DATAKIT_VERBOSE environment variable
  and turn-on more verbose logging of underlying libraries (#53 by @samoht)
- Replace Irmin views with a more efficient representation which does not
  keep track of transaction's actions and remove the need for creating temporary
  dangling commits (#16, #51 by @talex5)
- Backport performance fixes from upstream `ocaml-git` (#43, #47 by @talex5)
- Minimal integration with the Github PR API using 9p  (#42 by @samoht)

    ```
~/mnt $ ls github.com/docker/datakit
41  42
~/mnt $ cat github.com/docker/datakit/pr/41/status/default
pending
~/mnt $ echo success > github.com/docker/datakit/pr/41/status/default
    ```
- Use Astring and Logs (#50, #43 by @talex5 and @samoht)

### 0.2.0 (2016-03-18)

- Add support for "Git remotes" in the filesystem (#21, @samoht). Now you can:

    ```
    ~/mnt $ cd remotes
    ~/mnt/remotes $ mkdir origin
    ~/mnt/remotes $ echo https://github.com/docker/datakit > origin/url
    ~/mnt/remotes $ echo master > origin/fetch
    ~/mnt/remotes $ cat origin/head
    4b6557542ec9cc578d5fe09b664110ba3b68e2c2
    ```

- Remove dependency to gmp (@samoht)

- Split the library into 3 parts (@samoht)
